#2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data

#Quick note: usually floating numbers are used for speed, temperature and so on. Never used to count money.

hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
rate = input("Enter Rate")

pay = int(hrs) * float(rate)
print("Pay: " + str(pay))

#First soultion, completely valid
# print(int(hrs) * float(rate))
